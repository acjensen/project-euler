# Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

# Disclaimer
This is some of the first Python programming I ever did (2017 and earlier). As a result, the solutions may not be optimal. But its fun to look back and see how far I've come.
